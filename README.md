# LRT: Light Ray Tracer 
this repo contains my implementaion of a simple raytracer, implemented over the course of 3 days

## Testing
for this particular project, i found no need to use any test's other than generating an accurate looking image, which i did

# Resources used
* the only resource i used was Peter Shirley's book [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
* note that i implemented the raytracer just for metal and lamberitan material, i have zero interest in implementing other types of material (at least for this project)
